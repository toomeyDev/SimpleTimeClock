# SimpleTimeClock
A basic terminal/console based utility for recording hours, minutes, and seconds,
built with Python 3.

Useful for logging the amount of time worked or spent engaging in some activity,
timekeeping etc.
<hr>
Output is saved to a 'timesheet.txt' file by default, but can be configured
to save with any preferred filename.

Preferences menu allows for configuration of various program settings, 
including:
- Automatically append '.txt' to output files missing an extension
- Save timesheet files to a separate 'output' folder

For a full list of supported preferences, use the command 'preferences'
while the program is running.

Planned support for a variety of time entry formats 

IE (hrs minutes seconds, only minutes and seconds, condensed on one line)

For a full overview of planned entry formats, check the following issue:
