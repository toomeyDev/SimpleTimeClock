A basic terminal/console based utility for recording hours, minutes, and seconds,
built with Python 3.

Output is saved to a 'timesheet.txt' file by default, but can be configured
to save with any preferred filename.


## Preferences

including:
- Automatically append '.txt' to output files missing an extension
- Save timesheet files to a separate 'output' folder
- Insert date (year, month, day) before timesheet entries

For a full list of supported preferences, use the command 'preferences'
while the program is running.


### Entry formats

Supports a variety of entry formats, for information on these formats,
type 'formats-help' in the menu sequence of the program.

To change the currently selected entry format, type 'entry-format-set'
